This folder contains the rewritten calculate utility (the original is located at `../calculate` used to generate the list of activities ("consolidated activities") between a set of dates for all accounts. These are generated from a list of accounts and transfers.

Accounts consist of three types of transactions:
- Activities are single instance transactions
- Bills are repeating transactions
- Interests are repeating transactions that are based on an apr and the current account balance

Transfers represent money moving from one account to another, and are a list of bills and activities.

The measure of how well this rewrite scores is based on accuracy and performance.
- Accuracy. The final list of transactions should match what was generated by the original. There are test cases and files to run these cases in the `accuracy-comparison` folder, as well as the original results. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT METRIC.
- Performance. The runtime of a scenario should be short.

Development Notes:
- Always run tests with npx tsx
- Always run scripts from the root of the `calculate` folder

## Accuracy Comparison Structure

The `accuracy-comparison` folder contains three main scripts and associated data files for testing accuracy:

### Scripts

1. **`accuracy-comparison.ts`**
   - Main accuracy comparison script that compares calculate-v2 results against original API responses
   - Loads original responses, runs calculate-v2 for each scenario, and compares results
   - Generates detailed comparison results and summary statistics
   - Saves results to `comparison-results/` folder

2. **`fetch-original-responses.ts`**
   - Fetches original API responses from the running server for comparison testing
   - Tests 5 scenarios: historical_to_current, current_to_near_future, recent_to_medium_term, extended_projection, far_future_projection
   - Saves responses organized by scenario and a combined all-responses.json file

3. **`analyze-extra-activities.ts`**
   - Analyzes discrepancies between calculated and original results
   - Focuses on identifying extra activities that appear in calculate-v2 but not in original API
   - Provides detailed breakdown of differences for specific accounts (Kendall, Jake)

### Data Folders

1. **`original-responses/`**
   - Contains API responses from the original system for comparison
   - Files: `all-responses.json`, `all-responses-cleaned.json`, individual scenario files (e.g., `current_to_near_future.json`)
   - Serves as ground truth for accuracy testing

2. **`calculated-activities/`**
   - Contains results from calculate-v2 system
   - Currently has `current_to_near_future.json` with calculated activities for comparison

3. **`comparison-results/`**
   - Contains output from accuracy comparison tests
   - `accuracy-comparison.json`: Detailed comparison results for each account/scenario
   - `comparison-summary.json`: Summary statistics showing success rates, discrepancies, and performance by scenario

### Test Scenarios

The system tests 5 comprehensive scenarios covering different time ranges:
- `historical_to_current`: 2024-01-01 to 2025-07-19
- `current_to_near_future`: 2025-07-19 to 2025-08-19
- `recent_to_medium_term`: 2025-06-19 to 2026-07-19
- `extended_projection`: 2025-05-19 to 2035-07-19
- `far_future_projection`: 2045-07-19 to 2075-07-19

## Reading JSON Files

When working with JSON files, especially for testing and analysis, it's recommended to use tools like `jq` or write scripts to parse and analyze the data. This is more efficient than trying to grep through large JSON files, which can lead to incorrect results or missed data.

# Logging ans Debugging

You can use the logging utility in this folder to log messages and debug information. Available functions are `debug`, `log`, `warn`, and `error`. Each of these functions takes multiple string arguments and an optional final argument that can be an object. When processed through the `log-reader`, the messages will be formatted as follows:
```
<scenario> | <LEVEL> | <file>.<function> | <message> | <prop1>: <value1> | <prop2>: <value2> | ...
```
Where `<scenario>` is the scenario being processed, `<LEVEL>` is the log level (DEBUG, LOG, WARN, ERROR), `<file>` is the file name where the log was called, and `<function>` is the function name where the log was called. <message> is the main message, and each property is formatted as `<prop>: <value>`.

The scenario can be run and logs filtered sucinctly using a command similar to the following, replacing the last string with the regex you want to filter by:
```bash
npx tsx accuracy-comparison/accuracy-comparison.ts 2>&1 | tee /tmp/log && bat --plain /tmp/log | npx tsx accuracy-comparison/log-reader.ts --color="never" "DEBUG.*calculate.*prop1"
```

Memories:
- As results improve, commit the new changes
- create temporary test scripts in a "testing" folder
- Make sure to put debug and testing scripts in the testing folders
- Raw serialized activities contain a `from` field to represent the account a transfer is from. When instantiated as a class, this is mapped to a `fro` field
