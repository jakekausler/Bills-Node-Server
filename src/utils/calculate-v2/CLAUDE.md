This folder contains the rewritten calculate utility (the original is located at `../calculate` used to generate the list of activities ("consolidated activities") between a set of dates for all accounts. These are generated from a list of accounts and transfers.

Accounts consist of three types of transactions:
- Activities are single instance transactions
- Bills are repeating transactions
- Interests are repeating transactions that are based on an apr and the current account balance

Transfers represent money moving from one account to another, and are a list of bills and activities.

The measure of how well this rewrite scores is based on accuracy and performance.
- Accuracy. The final list of transactions should match what was generated by the original. There are test cases and files to run these cases in the `accuracy-comparison` folder, as well as the original results. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT METRIC.
- Performance. The runtime of a scenario should be short.

Development Notes:
- Always run tests with npx tsx

Memories:
- As results improve, commit the new changes
